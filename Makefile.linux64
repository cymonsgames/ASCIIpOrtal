# Native 64-bits Linux compilation for ASCIIpOrtal.
# Note that we assume having 

include Makefile.common

PORT = linux64


### Customisable variables ###

# Custom base name: everything (binary, tarballs) will be built using this base name.
# Unless heavy changes in the codebase (eg. a mod), you should use DISTNAME instead.
#ASCIIPORTAL := $(ASCIIPORTAL)-mod

# Custom base name for release (tarball). Keeping '-$(PORT)' is generally a good option,
# but feel free to change it.
DISTNAME := $(DISTNAME)-$(PORT)

# Custom C flags: you may define ('-D') or unset ('-U') macros to get your specific
# code to work.
CXXFLAGS := $(CXXFLAGS) -I/usr/include/xcurses `sdl-config --cflags` -U__NOSDL__ -U__NOSOUND__ -U__DINGOO__ -U__GP2X__

# Custom link flags: either dynamic (default) or static linking (see the last form,
# 'man ld' for details).
LINKFLAGS := $(LINKFLAGS) `sdl-config --libs` -L/usr/lib -l SDL_mixer -l pdcurses

# Additional files to be included in release tarball.
#FILES_INCLUDE_DIST := $(FILES_INCLUDE_DIST) custom_readme.txt example.dll foo/bar.xml


### Required variables ###

# C++ compiler. You might want to change this for cross-compilation.
CXX = g++

# Tarball name for release. You should not edit anything excepted the extension,
# see DISTNAME above.
#TARBALL = $(DISTNAME).zip
TARBALL = $(DISTNAME).tar.xz

# Final executable name. Same thing, you should only edit the extension.
#EXE_NAME = $(ASCIIPORTAL).exe
EXE_NAME = $(ASCIIPORTAL).x86_64


### Custom variables ###

# This is where you can manage additional variables. See 'Makefile.mingw32' for
# an example (downloading SDL dlls for windows).



### Required targets ###

# Dummy target if called directly
wrong-way:
	@echo
	@echo "[*] This Makefile is not intended to be run directly."
	@echo "[*] Instead, call the main Makefile with the proper target!"
	@echo "[*] In most cases, a simple 'make' should work though."

# Targets called by the main Makefile:
$(PORT):
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) clean execlean
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) $(EXE_NAME)
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) clean

dist:
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) clean execlean distclean saveclean
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) $(TARBALL)
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) clean execlean

all:
	$(MAKE) -f Makefile.$(PORT) dist

# This is supposed to work out-of-the-box
%.o: src/%.cpp
	$(CXX) -c $(CXXFLAGS) $<

# Replace by OBJECTS_NOSOUND if needed
$(EXE_NAME): $(OBJECTS)
	$(CXX) $^ $(LINKFLAGS) -o $@
	@echo
	@echo "[*] $(EXE_NAME) successfully built."

# You might want to add additional targets here (see 'Makefile.mingw32')
$(TARBALL): $(EXE_NAME)
	mkdir $(DISTNAME)
	cp -r $(FILES_INCLUDE_DIST) $(DISTNAME)
#	zip -r $@ $(DISTNAME) # zip is bad, but anyway...
#	tar czf $@ $(DISTNAME) # tar.gz
#	tar cjf $@ $(DISTNAME) # tar.bz2
	tar cJf $@ $(DISTNAME) # tar.xz
	rm -rf $(DISTNAME)
	ls $(TARBALL)
	@echo
	@echo "[*] $(TARBALL) successfully generated."

# This is supposed to clean anything you've added/compiled, excepted the
# main executable
clean:
	$(MAKE) clean

# Clean the generated executable
execlean:
	rm -f $(EXE_NAME)

# Clean the generated tarball
distclean:
	rm -f $(TARBALL)


### Custom targets ###

# This is for targets you would need somewhere. Again, see 'Makefile.mingw32'
# for an example
